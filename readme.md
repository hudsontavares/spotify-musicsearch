# Spotify Music Search API

This sample project is an AngularJS SPA that demonstrates how to display data consumed from Spotify's Open API.

## Installing / running it locally

1. Check if the most recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is available on your system and update it if necessary.
2. Clone the code repository on your local environment.
3. Using the command line, navigate to the root folder from the repo you just cloned on the previous step and execute `npm install`
4. Once the command finishes successfully, execute on the project's root folder `node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server` (replace slashes by backslashes on Windows)
5. Without stopping the process started on the previous step, type any of the URLs it displays on command line on your browser (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080 works, but double check whether you can find it on the URL list that is displayed to prevent unexpected problems)

## Development / build process
The development workflow tool of choice for this project is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). It will be automatically installed once you finish the install steps. The project doesn't require a global (`-g`) Gulp installation to work, you may run the following command from the root repository folder to execute the local gulp:

```
node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
```

(Replace slashes by backslashes on Windows)

The following tasks are available:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| sass | Transpiles all .sass files from project and places the output on css/default.css file |
| test | Runs the entire JS test suite on command line using Karma and PhantomJS |
| watch | Triggers `sass` and keeps a process that executes the task again as soon as some change is done on .sass file entries |
| default | Triggers watch |

**no changes** should be done directly on CSS. It is a SASS project, so anything that must be changed must be done on .sass files, that are the source from where the CSS is generated.

## Tests
The command line version of tests can be run using the aforementioned `gulp test` task, that seems to be the easiest way to execute them. On the visual front, the `/tests.html` page executes Jasmine tests too.

## Application architecture
- .idea **- project's visual diagrams**
- css **- result files from SASS compilation**
- images **- graphic data**
- sass **- source files that contains the presentation setup for the project**
- scripts **- on the root folder, the required libraries (angular.js, require.js, and so on)**
  - controllers **- angular controllers**
  - directives  **- angular directives**
  - models **- small function definitions, usually to provide initial parsing capabilities for that that arrives from API**
  - services **- angular services, injectable functionality that may or not receive other injectables**
  - templates **- HTML definition for directives**
  - tests **-test-related stuff like Jasmine libraries, setup scripts, and so on**
  - utils **- A small collection of functionality that can be consumed on various places**
- gulpfile.js **- Gulp tasks definition file**
- index.html **- Main application file**
- karma.conf.js **-Karma configuration**
- package.json **-NPM dependencies definition**
- readme.md **- This file ;)**
- tests.html **- Visual tool to run test cases**
